            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <h4><u>Early Childhood</u></h4>
            <h4><u>Involment in my Priory CCF</u></h4>
            <p>Joined the Combined Cadet Force(CCF) in March of 2018 and left around years later as i was going into
                higher education in my school and needed to focus more.
                In my time i had learnt valuable skills about leadership, teamwork, and uniform standards that would
                help me out in my time at school.
                Even through the times of covid the CCF was sure that the cadets would gain something,
                so they started virtual meetings and everyone had a choice of a later or early time,
                I chose the later time with the knowledge that their would be other people there,
                however, it ended up being just me and the instructor (thankfully this instructor was my favourite and
                the one who guided me to the CCF)</p>
            <P></P>
            <h4><u>Volunteering Work</u></h4>
            <p>Started volunteering at a childrens charity store in October of 2021.
                For the first few month due to me being 15 at the time i was unable to operate the till or the tagging
                machine,
                so my job mainly involved making the store look tidy and that all the stock on the floor hadnt been
                there too long.
                But by the start of the next year i was able to serve customers on the till and tag clothes,
                which became a valuable to skill to learn how to talk to the customers and helped me gain more
                experience in the store. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Aswell as working in a charity store i have helped out with events from the Lincoln City Foundation such
                as changemakers,
                which was an event planned by us to help raise money for any children who were too busy helping their
                family because they couldnt do things themselves,
                the money we raised with the help of charitys who sponsered us was to give these kids the funds to get
                an actual career for their family so they could live a normal childhood. </p>
